## reComBat-seq

reComBat-seq is a batch effect adjustment tool designed for bulk RNA-seq count data with underdetermined experimental designs. Building upon the negative binomial regression framework used in ComBat-seq[2], reComBat-seq incorporates Elastic Net regularization to address convergence issues when handling confounded data. It takes raw **untransformed, raw** count matrices as input and requires a known batch variable.

By applying regularized negative binomial regression, reComBat-seq models batch effects while enabling stable parameter estimation with rank-deficient design matrices. The adjusted data produced preserves the integer nature of counts, ensuring compatibility with widely used differential expression tools such as edgeR[1] and DESeq2. 

This formulation extends the standard negative binomial regression model by incorporating regularization penalties, with `NLL`representing the negative log-likelihood function.
```math
L(\beta) = NLL(\beta) + \lambda \bigg( \alpha \| \beta \|_1 + \bigg( \frac{1-\alpha}{2} \bigg) \| \beta \|_2^2 \bigg)
```

## Installation

reComBat-seq is available for installation via GitHub.

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jas-st/reComBat-seq")
```


## Usage and Tutorial

An example use case has been included in the `tutorial` folder. It analyses an Esophagus tissue dataset, containing cancer and healthy cells. 
A raw count matrix from RNA-Seq studies has to be provided, without any normalization or transformation, as well as a vector for batch separation). The `group` parameter specifies additional biological covariates, in this case the disease label of the cells.

```r
recombatseq_df <- reComBat_seq(counts_df_reduced, batch = batches, group = group,
                             lambda_reg=0.8, alpha_reg=0.3)
```

| Raw Data      | Corrected Data |

For multiple biological variables the `covar_mod` parameter can be used. In this example the matrix from the tutorial will be used.

```r
recombatseq_df_conf <- reComBat_seq(counts_df_reduced, batch = batches, covar_mod = covmat_model,
                                   lambda_reg=0.8, alpha_reg=0.3)
```

## Arguments

  - `counts` - raw count matrix from genomic studies (dimensions gene x sample)
  - `batch` - batch covariate (only one vector allowed)
  - `group` - vector / factor for condition of interest
  - `covar_mod` - model matrix for other covariates to include in linear model besides batch and condition of interest

The regularization can be adjusted via the following parameters:

  - `lambda_reg` - controls the strength of the regularization, $\lambda$ in the above equation
  - `alpha_reg` - controls the elastic net tuning, $\alpha$ in the above equation
