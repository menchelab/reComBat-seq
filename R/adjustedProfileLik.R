# Adapted from edgeR 4.0.1 (adjustedProfileLik.R)
# Modified by Zhasmina Stoyanova, 2026.
# Changes: added lambda_reg and alpha_reg parameters for elastic net regularization,
# passed through to the GLM fitting chain via glmFit.
# Original authors: Yunshun Chen, Gordon Smyth, Aaron Lun (see below).
#	Tagwise Cox-Reid adjusted profile log-likelihoods for the dispersion.
#	dispersion can be a scalar or a tagwise vector.
#	Computationally, dispersion can also be a matrix, but the apl is still computed tagwise.
#	y is a matrix: rows are genes/tags/transcripts, columns are samples/libraries.
#	offset is a matrix of the same dimensions as y.

#	The weights argument was added by Xiaobei Zhou 20 March 2013,
#	but the log NB probabilities were incorrectly multiplied by the weights.
#	This is fixed 1 March 2018 with a more rigorous interpretation of weights
#	in terms of averages.
